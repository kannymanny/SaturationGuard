# SaturationGuard
Control Plane Saturation Attack Mitigation in Software Defined Networks

Recent works have shown that the interaction between control and data plane in the Software Defined Networks
can be chocked by an adversary with saturation attack.
This attack is generated by sending large number of new flows to a
switch exploiting the switch-controller communication. A switch
sends a packet-in message to the controller if a new flow is seen. A
flux of new flows results in a large number of packet-in messages
at the controller.

In this paper, we present SaturationGuard which mitigates this attack by adopting an early attack detection
method. An anomaly detection method deployed at the controller observes the patterns of packet-in messages
and identifies the attack.
In particular, we capture normal interaction between
switch and controller using the arrival rate of packet-in messages
with a probability distribution. To mitigate the attack, we propose
to throttle the bandwidth of the affected switch port in proportion
to the arrival rate of new flows. We implement a proof of concept
solution with Mininet and an external controller and show
that SaturationGuard is effective in handling the saturation
attacks with early stage detection.
